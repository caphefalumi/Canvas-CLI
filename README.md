# Canvas CLI

A command line tool for interacting with the Canvas API using the Commander.js package.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- A Canvas account with API access

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Testing Your Setup

Before using the Canvas CLI, you can run a setup test to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
npm test
```

This will check:

- Node.js version compatibility
- Configuration file existence and format
- Required dependencies
- CLI functionality

### Global Installation (Optional)

To use the `canvas` command globally, install it as a global package:

```bash
npm install -g .
```

Or create a symlink:

```bash
npm link
```

## Configuration

The configuration file should be located at `$HOME/.config/canvas.toml` and follow this format:

```toml
[instance]
default="<nickname>"

[instance.<nickname>]
domain="domain.instructure.com"
token="<API TOKEN>"
```

### Example Configuration

```toml
[instance]
default="myschool"

[instance.myschool]
domain="myschool.instructure.com"
token="1234~abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

[instance.testschool]
domain="test.instructure.com"
token="5678~zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
```

### Getting Your API Token

1. Log into your Canvas instance
2. Go to Account â†’ Settings
3. Scroll down to "Approved Integrations"
4. Click "+ New Access Token"
5. Give it a purpose and expiration date
6. Copy the generated token

### Testing Configuration

```

This should return information about your user account.
